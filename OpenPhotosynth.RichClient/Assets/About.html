    <h1>Photosynth REST API Demo</h1>
    <p>This application demonstrates how to use the <a href="https://photosynth.net/api/docs/restapi.html">Photosynth REST API</a> in conjunction with Microsoft Account for authentication to create a desktop application
    for uploading images to create Technical Preview Photosynths. You can use this code as a basis to create your own. For example, you could provide creative
    and beautiful new ways for presenting a Photosynth user's library, or make a mobile app for capturing and uploading images.</p>
    <p>The OpenPhotosynth project is provided as a Portable Class Library, so you can use it across your Windows Store, Windows Phone, Silverlight and, of course,
    .NET desktop applications.</p>
    <p>All of the <a href="https://github.com/openps/ps-rich-client">source code</a> is released under the MIT License; feel free to use, modify and distribute this code as you see fit.</p>
    <p>See the official REST API documentation for more detailed information, and use the forum to reach out if you have any questions or issues.</p>
    <p>If you're looking for information about the Open Source Technical Preview Photosynth Viewer, you can find that <a href="https://photosynth.net/developer.aspx">here</a>.</p>

ps-rich-client
==============

A WPF-based Windows desktop application to demonstrate the Photosynth REST API.

It allows a Photosynth user to upload images for processing in the cloud to produce a Technical Preview Photosynth. For examples of Technical Preview Photosynths, visit https://photosynth.net/preview.

For documentation regarding the REST API, visit https://photosynth.net/api/docs/restapi.html. If you need write permission to manage content on the user's behalf (like this application does), you need to authenticate to Microsoft Account using your own client ID. Go to https://account.live.com/developers/applications to create your own application, then make a copy of Sample-App.config as App.config and adjust the client ID setting accordingly.

You can download a pre-compiled binary of this application as a Click-Once installation (may not always be up to date) from:
